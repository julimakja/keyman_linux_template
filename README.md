# Keyman Linux Template
*A minimal template for designing and building keyman keyboards solely on linux*

This is a quick template I adapted from a custom keyboard i designed and built without [keyman developer](https://keyman.com/developer/), as it's not available on linux, and it's a pain to get running on wine.

File tree for `TEMPLATE`:
```
TEMPLATE/
├── source/
│   ├── README.MD
│   ├── LICENSE.MD
│   ├── project_file.kpj
│   ├── keyboard_code.kmn
│   ├── icon.ico
│   └── xml_properties.kps
└── build/
```
Everything in the files is either commented or has its value replaced with instructions telling you what to do.

Enjoy!
